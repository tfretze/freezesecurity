### Intro

The security plus is an entry level certification for cyber security. I found the course content very extensive, and it gave me a base level understanding of many different cyber security concepts and topics. The exam was challenging for me in that I probably did not give it the respect it deserved in terms of allocating enough time to study. What I didn't like about the course was the rope learning of these topics and their acronyms, I have a very practical brain and learn better when there is an example or lab to reinforce my learning. If what you are looking for is a basic level of understanding for all the major topics of cybersecurity, Security plus has got you covered.      

### Tips

**Do as many practice exams as you can find! and then do them again!** 

It doesn't matter where you find them just keep doing them. Completing these will give you a feel for the types of questions that may appear. It will also help with those strangely worded questions that CompTIA love to throw at you. 

**Learn why an answer is wrong**

Doing practice exams is not just about getting the answer right, its about learning why you got a particular question wrong.

**Be able to differentiate between similar technologies, attacks, vulnerabilities, standards, etc...**

This will help immensely when doing the multiple choice questions as they will love to give you a question with answers that look very similar.

**Book the exam**

This may not seem like a tip but I found booking the exam really helped motivate me. I really did not want to have to take the exam again so this pushed me to start seriously getting into the study.

**Learn the acronyms**

Grab the exam objectives acronym list and write a brief description of every acronym in the list.

**Practice Networking**

Learn basic networking and be able to differentiate between ports and services and how to allow or deny their communication through a firewall.
