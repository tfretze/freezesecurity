### Tips

**Do as many practice exams as you can find! and then do them again!** 

It doesn't matter where you find them just keep doing them. Completing these will give you a feel for the types of questions that may appear. 

**Learn why an answer is wrong**

Doing practice exams is not just about getting the answer right, its about learning why you got a particular question wrong.

**Be able to differentiate between similar technologies, attacks, vulnerabilites, standards, etc...**

This will help immensely when doing the multiple choice questions as they will love to give you a question with answers that look very similar.

**Practice Networking**

Learn basic networking and be able to differentiate between ports and services and how to allow or deny them communication through a firewall
